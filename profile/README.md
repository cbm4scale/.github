# Welcome to CBM4scale -- Compressed Binary Matrix Algorithms for Scaling :wave:

## What is Project CBM4scale?

The aim of the CBM4Scale innovation study is to design and implement a
fundamentally new algorithm that enables the construction of a novel Compressed
Binary Matrix (CBM) storage format and the optimization of associated matrix
operations. By integrating the CBM format and the corresponding compressed
binary matrix multiply kernel (CBMM) into a widely used Graph Neural Network
(GNN) framework, we will demonstrate significant performance improvements for
important HPC applications on current and future European supercomputers.

The innovation study will be conducted in cooperation between [INESC-ID Lisboa](https://www.inesc-id.pt)
and the [University of Vienna](https://sc.cs.univie.ac.at/research/projects/project/390/).

The CBM4Scale innovation study is funded by
[Inno4scale](https://www.inno4scale.eu/), a European initiative for supporting
the development of innovative algorithms for exascale supercomputers. The
initiative has received funding from the European High-Performance Computing
Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 101118139. The JU receives
support from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Programme.
